              "'Page: ChatGPT\\nSummary: ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in 2022. It is currently based on the GPT-4o large language model (LLM). ChatGPT can generate human-like conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.\\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months and contributing to the growth of OpenAI\\'s current valuation of $86 billion. ChatGPT\\'s release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok. Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI\\'s GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems. As of July 2024, ChatGPT\\'s website is among the 10 most-visited websites globally.\\nChatGPT is built on OpenAI\\'s proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o. The ChatGPT \"Plus\", \"Pro\", \"Team\", and \"Enterprise\" subscriptions provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation, more capable AI models, and an increased usage limit.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: ChatGPT in education\\nSummary: The usage of ChatGPT in education has sparked considerable debate and exploration. ChatGPT is a chatbot based on large language models (LLMs) that was released by OpenAI in November 2022. Educators\\' opinions vary widely; while some are skeptical about the benefits, many see them as valuable tools.\\nChatGPT serves multiple educational purposes, including providing topic overviews, generating ideas, and assisting in drafting. A 2023 study highlighted its greater acceptance among professors compared to students. Moreover, chatbots show promise in personalized tutoring.\\nEfforts to ban chatbots like ChatGPT in schools focus on preventing cheating, but enforcement faces challenges due to AI detection inaccuracies and widespread accessibility of chatbot technology. Banning could also hinder students\\' opportunities to learn effective technology usage, while straining teacher-student relationships.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: OpenAI\\nSummary: OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015 and headquartered in San Francisco, California. Its stated mission is to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\". As a leading organization in the ongoing AI boom, OpenAI is known for the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\\nThe organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc., registered in Delaware, and its for-profit subsidiary introduced in 2019, OpenAI Global, LLC. Microsoft owns roughly 49% of OpenAI\\'s equity, having invested US$13 billion. It also provides computing resources to OpenAI through its cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.\\nIn 2023 and 2024, O'"

He is known for his fast-paced and high-production YouTube videos, in which he often hosts elaborate challenges and donates large amounts of money. With over 350 million subscribers, he has the most subscribers of any YouTube channel and is the third-most-followed creator on TikTok with over 106.9 million followers. He also has over 63.9 million followers on Instagram and over 31.4 million on X (formerly Twitter).\n",
            "Donaldson was raised in Greenville, North Carolina. He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012 under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to \"videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers\". He went viral in 2017 after his \"counting to 100,000\" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days. His videos have become increasingly grand and extravagant. Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some childhood friends to co-run the brand. Donaldson also runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts (formerly BeastHacks), MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts), and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy.\n",
            "Donaldson is the founder of MrBeast Burger, Feastables, and a co-founder of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $24 million for its campaigns, and Lunchly, a food and snack brand similar to Lunchables. He also co-founded Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million. Donaldson won the Creator of the Year award four years in a row at the Streamy Awards in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023; he also won the Favorite Male Creator award three times at the 2022, 2023, and 2024 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. In 2023, Time named him one of the world's 100 most influential people. He has ranked on the Forbes list for the highest-paid YouTube creator in 2022 and has an estimated net worth of $500 million.\n",

            "Summary: ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in 2022. It is currently based on the GPT-4o large language model (LLM). ChatGPT can generate human-like conversational responses and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.\n",
            "By January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion. ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok. Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems. As of July 2024, ChatGPT's website is among the 10 most-visited websites globally.\n",
            "ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free tier can access GPT-4o. The ChatGPT \"Plus\", \"Pro\", \"Team\", and \"Enterprise\" subscriptions provide additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation, more capable AI models, and an increased usage limit.\n",

Educators' opinions vary widely; while some are skeptical about the benefits, many see them as valuable tools.\n",
            "ChatGPT serves multiple educational purposes, including providing topic overviews, generating ideas, and assisting in drafting. A 2023 study highlighted its greater acceptance among professors compared to students. Moreover, chatbots show promise in personalized tutoring.\n",
            "Efforts to ban chatbots like ChatGPT in schools focus on preventing cheating, but enforcement faces challenges due to AI detection inaccuracies and widespread accessibility of chatbot technology.
